In order to install the distribution, copy the files (with the
exception of the .afm files, not needed by LaTeX) to a directory
searched by LaTeX and dvips.

To process the example files, try the commands:

                latex <name>.tex
                dvips -j0 -P <name> <name>.dvi

where <name> is the base name of the afm and pfb files (one of Acorn,
AnnSton, ...); to process the example files without any previous
installation, try with

        TEXCONFIG="\!\!:." dvips -j0 -P <name> <name>.dvi

from the current directory (for the Bourne shell; for C-like shells I
don't know how to change an environment variable on-the-fly).

For what concerns the "-j0", this option should not be needed by
modern versions of dvips (the PostScript output has been generated
by dvips 5.92b); I suspect that these fonts are not completely well
formed internally, but I do not have the time to investigate more
--- using -j0 the PostScript output is consistent.  Also, Acrobat
Reader 5.06 chokes on some PDF files (while xpdf has no problems),
in particular the big ones like GoudyInitials; the PDF output has
been generated by Ghostscript 8.00.

The same files are available on the WWW under the URL
